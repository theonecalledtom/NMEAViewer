# NMEAViewer

This is a simple (?) application that can open a COM port connection and listen to a subset of NMEA0183 messages.

It then generates graphs of data such as TWS, AWA, boat speed, GPS speed, location etc, and can show histograms of ranges of that data.

Development is ongoing, version is a 0.1 not a 1.0.
